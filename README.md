# Student Report Card
### **Overview:**  
This project focuses on **creating an interactive Student Report Card System** using **Microsoft Excel**. Instead of building a dashboard, the project starts by **creating a structured student database** that includes essential details like **Student ID, Name, Subjects, Marks, Total Marks, and Final Result**. Using this data, an interactive report card is generated, allowing users to **select a Student ID** and instantly view the corresponding student‚Äôs performance.  

### **Key Features:**  

1. **Student Database Creation:**  
- Stores student information, including:  
  - **Student ID**  
  - **Student Name**  
  - **Subjects & Individual Marks**  
  - **Total Marks**  
  - **Final Result (Pass/Fail)**  

2. **Dynamic Report Card Generation:**  
- Users select a **Student ID** from a dropdown list.  
- The system automatically fetches and displays:  
  - **Subject-wise Marks**  
  - **Total Marks & Percentage**  
  - **Final Result (Pass/Fail)**  

3. **Automated Grade Calculation:**  
- Assigns grades based on percentage (e.g., **A for 90-100%, B for 80-89%, etc.**).  
- Highlights **students who need improvement** using conditional formatting.  

3. **Interactive Filtering & Selection:**  
- Enables **real-time drill-downs** based on student selection.  
- Updates dynamically when a new **Student ID** is chosen.  

4. **Data Visualization & Formatting:**  
- Used **Excel Formulas** (SUM, AVERAGE, IF, etc.) for calculations.  
- Applied **Conditional Formatting** to enhance readability.  

### **Tools and Technologies Used:**  

üìå **Microsoft Excel:**  
- **Data Storage:** Managed student records efficiently.  
- **Formulas & Functions:** Used for automatic calculations.  
- **Conditional Formatting:** Highlighted performance trends.  
- **Dropdown Lists & Slicers:** Enabled interactive selection.
